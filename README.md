# Celery-and-Fast-API
In this course, you will learn how to integrate Celery with a FastAPI application, enabling the handling of asynchronous tasks to enhance user experience. 
## Overview

In this course, you will learn how to integrate Celery with a FastAPI application, enabling the handling of asynchronous tasks to enhance user experience. The combination of FastAPI and Celery allows for efficient execution of tasks such as:

-   Running machine learning models
-   Sending bulk emails
-   Processing images or PDFs
-   Generating exports of user data
-   Performing backups

These activities are critical in modern web applications, and this course will guide you through configuring, testing, deploying, and monitoring Celery tasks to ensure they function correctly outside the HTTP request/response cycle.

## What You Will Learn

### Part 1: Foundation and Concepts

-   **Configure Celery with FastAPI**: Learn to set up Celery to work seamlessly with FastAPI.
-   **Docker Integration**: Containerize FastAPI, Celery, and Redis using Docker.
-   **Task Management**: Create and manage Celery tasks effectively.
-   **SQLAlchemy Integration**: Ensure Celery tasks work correctly with SQLAlchemy database transactions.
-   **Error Handling and Debugging**: Retry failed tasks and debug them efficiently.

### Part 2: Deployment, Testing, and Best Practices

-   **Task Validation**: Ensure that Celery tasks execute correctly with proper validation.
-   **Real-time Notifications**: Use Broadcaster and Python-Socket.IO to receive real-time push notifications from Celery tasks.

## Learning Objectives

-   Containerize FastAPI, Celery, and Redis with Docker.
-   Ensure Celery tasks execute correctly with validation and debugging.
-   Create and manage Celery tasks.
-   Use Broadcaster and Python-Socket.IO for real-time push notifications from Celery.
